## Postfix to Prefix Converter

This project is a tool for converting data from postfix to prefix form. 

Postfix notation is a way of writing mathematical expressions where the operator comes after the operands. Prefix notation, on the other hand, is a way of writing mathematical expressions where the operator comes before the operands.

This converter tool supports file mode, which means that you can receive data from a file or console, and output data to a file or console as well.
